# SalesPrediction
Sales and Production Prediction

#This project is the term project of BLG440E 2016 Spring Term Course.

Project Description:

•	Project Description

	İmplementing an analysis of  forecasting sales of products in a script based language like R or Python etc. using sales quantity dataset.

	There are a lot of location and manifacturing center,predicting new date’s quantity of sales facilitates the optimization product and increasing costs.

•	Project Requirements

	Time information lists of sales.

	Manifacturing center information.

	Locations

	Product id and name

	Main group information of the product.

	Subgroups.

	Product genre

	Quantity

	İnput format is time information and sum of quantity of sales by grouping times.

•	Project Steps

	Construct a use case for predicting the new quantity of sales.

	Understand the data’s structure by statistically.

	Normalizing for preparing dataset of getting the stationary.

	Determine a threshold.

	Finding the optimum model for phase of prediction by tests.

	Compare model success and choose the best.

	İmplement the reasonable model for prediction and print outputs by the fitted and predicted values by date,quantity,any identified groups,confidence limit information.

	Graph them for a good comparing model success by a language.
